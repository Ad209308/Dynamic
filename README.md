## About Me
With over 11 years of experience in the manufacturing industry and nearly 7 years specializing in Project Management within Global Engineering Services, I have developed a comprehensive expertise in product design, development, and manufacturing. My background includes a robust understanding of project management principles, encompassing integration, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource management, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholder engagement, and supply chain management.

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed more than 100 projects from inception to completion, consistently delivering results that align with business objectives and client expectations. My role involved overseeing projects with international customers, handling a portfolio valued at nearly $10 million annually. This responsibility required a deep understanding of diverse business requirements, supply chain logistics, procurement strategies, and the ability to meet stringent deliverables.

One of my key achievements has been building and nurturing relationships with over 50 clients, which has significantly contributed to more than $20 million in repeat business since 2016. This accomplishment underscores my ability to foster strong client partnerships and ensure ongoing business growth.

In terms of financial impact, I led a transformative project that saved $2.3 million annually. This success was achieved through the end-to-end mapping of business processes using a combination of data analysis, system analysis, process improvement, and requirements engineering. My approach involved leveraging a range of project management tools and methodologies, including Microsoft Project Management, SAP, PCMRP, SharePoint, SDLC, and PDLC, as well as Scrum and Agile methodologies, to effectively track and manage project assignments.

My extensive experience and expertise in project management have equipped me with a deep understanding of how to navigate complex projects and deliver value. My ability to integrate advanced project management tools and methodologies with practical business insights has consistently resulted in successful project outcomes and significant cost savings. I am committed to driving excellence and achieving project success through strategic planning, effective execution, and continuous improvement.
